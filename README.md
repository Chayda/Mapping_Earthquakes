# Mapping_Earthquakes
## An interactive map of earthquakes
Data visualization of earthquake data using an API to obtain latest earthquake GeoJSON data from U.S. Geological Survey Website. JavaScript using Leaflet and d3 libraries to show earthquake data to map the magnitude and location of each earthquake. The diameter of the markers on the map reflect the magnitude of each earthquake. There are overlays to toggle, showing the earthquakes in relation to tectonic plates' location on the earth and all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
